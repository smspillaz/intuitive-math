/*
 * LanguageProvider Slice
 *
 * Here we define:
 * - The shape of our container's slice of Redux store,
 * - All the actions which can be triggered for this slice, including their effects on the store.
 *
 * Note that, while we are using dot notation in our reducer, we are not actually mutating the state
 * manually. Under the hood, we use immer to apply these updates to a new copy of the state.
 * Please see https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction for more information.
