  <Section title="Inverses" anchor="inverses">
    <p>
      We saw earlier that products of matrices and vectors have a definition
      that can be understood through the lens of transformation. But what about
      division by a matrix? The only intuitive definition we can think of might
      be dividing every coefficient in an{' '}
      <MathJax.Node inline formula="m \times n" /> matrix, but that would run
      counter to our understanding of multiplication, which is defined on
      matrices of size <MathJax.Node inline formula="m \times n" /> and{' '}
      <MathJax.Node inline formula="n \times m" />, where each component becomes
      a dot product of its corresponding row and column.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, we might want to think about division in terms of multiplication.
      Remember that multiplying any number by a fraction with numerator 1 is a
      division by the denominator of that fraction. And also recall that any
      fraction with numerator 1 is the <Strong>inverse</Strong> of
      multiplication by the denominator, in the sense that if we multiply 1 by
      the denominator, multiplying by the fraction will undo the multiplication
      and yield 1 again.
    </p>
    <MathJax.Node formula="1 \times a \times \frac{1}{a} = 1" />
    <p>
      For the sake of notational convenience, we usually refer to such fractions
      as negative exponents, since we can exploit the fact that multiplying two
      numbers together adds their powers and the sum of 1 and -1 is zero.
    </p>
    <MathJax.Node formula="1 \times a^1 \times a^{-1} = a^0 = 1" />
    <p>
      Note that not every number has an inverse. In particular, if what we are
      multiplying by is zero then there is no way that you can use a function to
      get the number back, since zero times anything is zero. Expressed as
      fractional notation, it would not make much sense either:
    </p>
    <MathJax.Node formula="1 \times 0 \times \frac{1}{0} = ?" />
    <p>
      In those cases, we say that the number has no inverse, since it would be
      the same thing as dividing by zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can express the same thing for matrices as well - the product of any
      matrix and its inverse (if the inverse exists) will always be the
      indentity matrix, <MathJax.Node inline formula="I" />
    </p>
    <MathJax.Node formula="A^{-1} \times A = I" />
    <p>
      So if we can find <MathJax.Node inline formula="A^{-1}" /> then by
      premultiplying a matrix by it, we are effectively dividing by{' '}
      <MathJax.Node inline formula="A" />.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, note that not every matrix has an inverse. Recall that some
      transformations squash all of space on to a line or a plane:
    </p>
    <TweenedAffineTransformCube
      start={[
        [1, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 1],
      ]}
      end={[
        [1, 1, 0],
        [1, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 1],
      ]}
      wireframe
      title="Matrix that squishes space into a plane"
    />
    <p>
      In this case, it would be impossible to find a matrix that would go back
      to our original space, since multiple points within the space all could
      have ended up in the same position on the plane. We also said that at
      least for this 3x3 transformation that it had an overall volume of zero
      and thus the determinant was zero. We will see shortly why a zero
      determinant means that an inverse cannot exist formally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for computing inverses. We will start with the 2x2 case. In this
      instance, I am just going to throw down a formula, but be aware that the
      formula is not a general or even recursive definition for how an inverse
      is calculated, but is really just a shortcut for the 2x2 case:
    </p>
    <MathJax.Node formula="\frac{1}{\det A} \begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{pmatrix}" />
    <p>
      You would be forgiven for thinking that formula had been pulled out of
      nowhere, so lets break it down into its components by focusing on an
      example: a matrix that scales by 2 in both directions and rotates
      counterclockwise.
    </p>
    <MathJaxMatrix
      matrix={[
        [0, 2],
        [-2, 0],
      ]}
    />
    <InterpolatedAnimation
      values={{
        xScale: { begin: 1, end: 0 },
        xShear: { begin: 0, end: 2 },
        yShear: { begin: 0, end: -2 },
        yScale: { begin: 1, end: 0 },
      }}
      render={({ xScale, xShear, yShear, yScale }) => {
        const mat = new Matrix3();

        mat.set(
          xScale.value,
          xShear.value,
          0,
          yShear.value,
          yScale.value,
          0,
          0,
          0,
          0,
        );

        const iHat = new Vector3(1, 0, 0);
        const jHat = new Vector3(0, 1, 0);

        iHat.applyMatrix3(mat);
        jHat.applyMatrix3(mat);

        return (
          <AxisVisualization2D
            title="System that rotates clockwise through two shears and negative scale by 2"
            render={() => (
              <group>
                <Vector position={iHat} color={0xffff00} />
                <Vector position={jHat} color={0xff00ff} />
              </group>
            )}
          />
        );
      }}
    />
    <p>
      Now, consider just multiplying the transformed basis vectors by the
      rearranged matrix we saw earlier. Does this get us back to the standard
      basis vectors?
    </p>
    <MathJaxMatrix
      matrix={[
        [0, -2],
        [2, 0],
      ]}
    />
    <InterpolatedAnimation
      values={{
        xScale: { begin: 1, end: 0 },
        xShear: { begin: 0, end: -2 },
        yShear: { begin: 0, end: 2 },
        yScale: { begin: 1, end: 0 },
      }}
      render={({ xScale, xShear, yShear, yScale }) => {
        const mat = new Matrix3();
        mat.set(0, 2, 0, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);

        const inverse = new Matrix3();
        inverse.set(
          xScale.value,
          xShear.value,
          0,
          yShear.value,
          yScale.value,
          0,
          0,
          0,
          0,
        );

        const iHat = new Vector3(1, 0, 0);
        const jHat = new Vector3(0, 1, 0);

        iHat.applyMatrix3(mat);
        jHat.applyMatrix3(mat);

        iHat.applyMatrix3(inverse);
        jHat.applyMatrix3(inverse);

        return (
          <AxisVisualization2D
            title="Attempt to invert a system by just multiplying by rearranged matrix"
            render={() => (
              <group>
                <Vector position={iHat} color={0xffff00} />
                <Vector position={jHat} color={0xff00ff} />
              </group>
            )}
          />
        );
      }}
    />
    <p>
      Unfortunately that did not quite do what we wanted. We rotated back to our
      basis vectors, but now they are four times as big! The problem with just
      rearranging the matrix like this is that it did not undo the change in the
      area, in fact, the determinant of the transformation was preserved so by
      multiplying by the new matrix, we just made space twice more expanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the reason why in order to find the inverse, we also need to undo
      the change in the determinant by scaling by the inverse of the
      determinant.
    </p>
    <MathJax.Node
      formula={
        '\\frac{1}{0 \\times 0 - 2 \\times -2} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -2 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}'
      }
    />
    <MathJax.Node
      formula={
        '\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -2 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}'
      }
    />
    <p>
      Now, if we do that, the transformation takes us back to our basis vectors.
      Note that the fact that we multiply by the inverse of the determinant
      means that some matrices are by definition non-invertable, because we
      cannot multiply by the inverse of zero.

      Now if this section followed the others, it would give a generalized
      technique for extending this knowledge into multiple dimensions.
      Unfortunately, there is no general mechanism for computing inverses of
      <MathJax.Node inline formula="n \times m" /> matrices. Instead, we will
      explore a more algorithmic approach using{' '}
      <Strong>Elementary Row Operations</Strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that by using <Strong>Elementary Row Operations</Strong> that we
      were able to take a complex looking transformation and reduce it down to
      the identity matrix. If we were able to represent those operations as a
      matrix, that matrix would be the inverse of the original matrix.
    </p>
    <p>Consider the same 3x3 transformation we row-reduced above:</p>
    <MathJaxMatrix
      matrix={[
        [1, -1, 0],
        [-1, -1, 0],
        [2, 1, 2],
      ]}
    />
    <p>
      We will row-reduce it again, but this time, we will apply the same
      operations to the identity matrix and observe how that transformation
      affects an already transformed unit cube. So, side by side:
    </p>

      matrix={[
        [1, -1, 0],
        [-1, -1, 0],

      inverse={[
        [1, 0, 0],

    <p>First, subtract 2 times the first row from the third.</p>

      inverse={[

        [-2, 0, 1],
      ]}
      title="Super-elementary-row-reduction (1)"

    <p>Now subtract the second row from the first.</p>
    <CubeVectorsAnimatedSuperERO
      matrix={[

        [-2, 0, 1],

      title="Super-elementary-row-reduction (3)"

    <p>Add three times the second row to the third</p>

    <p>
      Clean up the matrix by multipying the first row by{' '}
      <MathJax.Node inline formula="1 \over 2" />, the second row by -1 and the
      third row by <MathJax.Node inline formula="1 \over 2" />.
