    <p>
      Knowing that a span is the space <Strong>spanned</Strong> by a set of
      vectors, we might want to go the other way and find a set of vectors that
      describe the space. That set of vectors will be called a{' '}
      <Strong>basis</Strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding that set only requires that we impose two conditions we already
      know about on a set of vectors.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The set of vectors must span the space we want to describe.</li>
      <li>
        The set of vectors must be linearly independent: that is to say that
        there must not be any <Strong>redundant</Strong> vectors in the set.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With these definitions in mind, we can already make some observations
      about the basis.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        An <MathJax.Node inline formula="n" />
        -dimensional space must have at least{' '}
        <MathJax.Node inline formula="n" /> vectors in its basis, such that it
        could span the entire space.
      </li>
      <li>
        An <MathJax.Node inline formula="n" />
        -dimensional space must have at most <MathJax.Node
          inline
          formula="n"
        />{' '}
        vectors in its basis such that no vector is linearly dependant on
        another.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Generally speaking, if you have some <MathJax.Node inline formula="n" />
      -dimensional space then it should always be possible to, using{' '}
      <MathJax.Node inline formula="n" /> vectors that form a basis, reach every
      possible point in that space with linear combinations of those{' '}
      <MathJax.Node inline formula="n" /> vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should come as no surprise that in 3-dimensional space, the unit
      vectors
      <MathJaxMatrix inline matrix={[[1], [0], [0]]} />{' '}
      <MathJaxMatrix inline matrix={[[0], [1], [0]]} />{' '}
      <MathJaxMatrix inline matrix={[[0], [0], [1]]} /> are a basis for the
      three dimensional space. It should be obvious that by scaling each of them
      by a different constant and adding them all together that any point in
      that space can be reached.

      Because of that, we have special names for them:{' '}
      <MathJax.Node inline formula="\hat i" />,{' '}
      <MathJax.Node inline formula="\hat j" /> and{' '}
      <MathJax.Node inline formula="\hat k" />.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unit vectors are not the only valid basis for an n-dimensional space,
      however. Those vectors could be scaled by any amount and they would still
      be a basis, where we could combine those three to reach any other vector.

    <p>
      In fact, you could imagine squeezing all of those vectors in towards a
      line and as long as they all point in different directions, it is still
      possible to combine them in such a way such that it is possible to reach
      any point in the space with them.

      It makes more sense if you think about what happens to the rest of space
      if you apply the same change in the basis vectors to every other part of
      the space.

      It is only when all of space is flattened on to a line or a plane that
      those vectors stop being a basis for the rest of the space.
