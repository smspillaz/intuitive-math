    <p>
      Much ado gets made about linear independence, probably because it makes up
      quite a few questions where the answer is not immediately obvious. It is
      also a bit of terminology that gets in the way of understanding. Its hard
      to imagine vectors being dependent on each other, surely they can be
      manipulated independently?
    </p>
    <p>
      When we talk about linear independence what we are actually talking about
      is whether a vector in a set of vectors actually gives us the freedom to
      move in another dimension or whether it is trapped in the same dimension
      already described by other vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, even that is a little misleading. You could have vectors with
      non-zero numbers in every dimension but they still may be linearly
      dependent. So what we are actually talking about is whether that vector in
      combination with other vectors gives us access to more space. This is best
      illustrated in the two dimensional case with a visual explanation.

    <AxisVisualization2D
      title="Two vectors on the same line"
      render={() => (
        <group>
          <Vector position={new Vector3(1, 2, 0)} color={0xffff00} />
          <Vector position={new Vector3(2, 4, 0)} color={0xff00ff} />
        </group>
      )}
    />
    <p>
      These two vectors are not linearly independent. The reason why is that the
      first vector describes the line <MathJax.Node inline formula="y = 2x" />{' '}
      and the second vector describes the line{' '}
      <MathJax.Node inline formula="2y = 4x" />.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that is the exact same line! If we were to add any scalar multiple of
      these two vectors, you would still get another vector that describes the
      line <MathJax.Node inline formula="y = 2x" />. So we say that they are{' '}
      <Strong>Linearly Dependent</Strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Linear dependence is kind of obvious in the 2-vectors, 2-dimensions case,
      because it basically only comes up when the set of vectors are just scalar
      multiples of each other. But what happens if you have 3 vectors in a two
      dimensional space?

    <AxisVisualization2D

      render={() => (
        <group>
          <Vector position={new Vector3(1, 1, 0)} color={0xffff00} />
          <Vector position={new Vector3(1, 2, 0)} color={0xff00ff} />
          <Vector position={new Vector3(4, 5, 0)} color={0x00fff} />
        </group>
      )}
    />
    <p>
      These vectors are still linearly dependent, even though none of them line
      on the same line. The reason is that now instead of lying on the same
      line, they all line on the same <Strong>plane</Strong>, which by
      definition, is the entire 2D co-ordinate space. By scaling the lines
      describes by <MathJax.Node inline formula="y = x" /> and
      <MathJax.Node inline formula="2y = x" />, adding them together and so on.
      I can reach any point in 2D space already. I do not need{' '}
      <MathJax.Node inline formula="5y = 4x" /> in order to get access to any
      more space.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, lets make the vector <MathJax.Node inline formula="(4, 5)" />{' '}
      using <Strong>only</Strong> <MathJax.Node inline formula="(1, 1)" /> and{' '}
      <MathJax.Node inline formula="(1, 2)" />.
    </p>
    <MathJax.Node
      inline
      formula="1 \times ((1, 2) - (1, 1)) + 4 \times (1, 1) = 1 \times (0, 1) + 4 \times (1, 1) = (4, 5)"
    />
    <p>
      This is a little more subtle when we move into three dimensions. Just
      because you have three vectors, it doesnt mean that they are all linearly
      independent.
    </p>
    <p>Obviously, you can get a case where they represent the same line</p>

    />
    <p>
      It is not immediately obvious, but adding the third vector to the other
      two does not get you outside of the plane that the other two are
      describing. So they are linearly dependent.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we can get rid of the third vector and still be describing the same
      plane.
